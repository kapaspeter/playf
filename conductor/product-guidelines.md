# Product Guidelines: Plyfull

## Brand Messaging & Tone
- **Voice:** A "Balanced" tone that bridges the gap between the excitement of a playground and the professional requirements of schools and corporate entities.
- **Copywriting Style:** Friendly and welcoming when describing activities, but clear and precise when detailing pricing, packages, and technical requirements for group bookings.

## Visual Identity & Design
- **Color Palette:** A combination of "Modern Pastels" and "Classic Playground" elements. Use soft, premium background tones (Mint, Coral, Sky Blue) accented with energetic primary colors for calls to action and key highlights.
- **Themes:** Full support for Dark and Light modes using semantic CSS variables to maintain brand consistency across different environments.
- **Typography:** Legible and modern, using clean sans-serif fonts that feel contemporary yet accessible.
- **Imagery:** Primary use of "Abstract illustrations or icons" to represent various services and packages, maintaining a clean and cohesive visual language.

## Localization & Multilingual Strategy
- **Approach:** Ensure English, Hungarian, and Romanian versions are consistent yet culturally appropriate, leveraging Markdown for efficient content management.

## Accessibility & Performance
- **Contrast:** High contrast for all text and interactive elements to ensure readability for all users.
- **HTML:** Semantic HTML structure to support accessibility standards.
- **Styling:** Pure Vanilla CSS to maintain a lightweight footprint and extremely fast loading speeds across all devices.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Simplicity:** Minimize friction in the reservation process with a clear, step-by-step form.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a unified look and feel across all language versions of the site.
